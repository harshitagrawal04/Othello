Nice — this is a clear, achievable project. Below is a **complete roadmap** for building a polished, pure-C++ Reversi/Othello for **macOS** with a game-style canvas UI and three AI difficulties. We’ll follow it step-by-step (you asked not to get everything at once — so this message is *only* the roadmap; after you confirm we’ll start **Phase 1** and I’ll give you the exact classes/functions/small pseudocode you’ll need).

# Roadmap — high level (phases & deliverables)

## Phase 0 — Project planning & tooling

**Goal:** pick the toolchain and create a reproducible project scaffold.
**Tasks**

* Choose C++ standard (C++17 or C++20 recommended).
* Choose build system (CMake recommended).
* Create git repo and basic folder layout (`src/`, `include/`, `assets/`, `tests/`, `build/`).
* Create small README with goals and dev notes.
  **Deliverable:** empty project scaffold with CMake and a trivial “hello” build.

---

## Phase 1 — Core game model (no UI)

**Goal:** implement pure game rules and a console/test harness so logic is rock-solid.
**Tasks**

* Design board representation (8×8), constants and enums (BLACK, WHITE, EMPTY).
* Implement move detection and flipping rules.
* Methods: initialize board, list legal moves, apply move (with flipping), undo move, count discs, check game end.
* Add a simple console interface to play moves and display board textually.
* Unit tests for every rule and edge case.
  **Deliverable:** testable CLI Reversi engine (can be used independently of UI).

---

## Phase 2 — Move validation & utilities (correctness & performance)

**Goal:** make move-generation robust and efficient.
**Tasks**

* Optimize legal-move generator (check 8 directions, return flips efficiently).
* Implement helper utilities: coordinate conversions, move lists, equality/hashing for states.
* Add an undo stack (store flipped discs / changed cells) for fast undo.
* Add debug logging & asserts for invariants.
  **Deliverable:** fast, well-tested move generator and undo support.

---

## Phase 3 — AI design & implementation (three difficulties)

**Goal:** implement the three bot levels: Easy, Medium, Hard.
**Tasks**

* **Easy:** random valid move (or weighted randomness).
* **Medium:** shallow search (minimax) with a simple heuristic (mobility + corner priority + static positional weights).
* **Hard:** deeper Minimax with alpha-beta pruning, iterative deepening, move ordering; optionally transposition table (Zobrist hashing) to cache positions.
* Provide a parameterized AI engine so difficulty = {search depth, heuristic weights, randomness level}.
* Run self-play tests to sanity-check difficulty differences.
  **Deliverable:** AIEngine with three selectable difficulty modes.

---

## Phase 4 — Rendering & input (game canvas)

**Goal:** get a polished, scalable board rendered and respond to mouse input.
**Tasks**

* Choose a rendering framework (we’ll pick the exact option next — options include SFML, SDL2+OpenGL, GLFW+OpenGL, or Qt).
* Implement a renderer that:

  * Draws the 8×8 board with crisp lines and retina-aware scaling.
  * Draws discs with smooth flip animation.
  * Highlights legal moves on hover and shows current player.
  * Handles window resizing & DPI scaling.
* Implement input handling: mouse clicks map to board cells, UI events for menus.
  **Deliverable:** interactive, well-scaled board canvas with animations.

---

## Phase 5 — UI shell & polish

**Goal:** add menus, dialogs, settings, and visual polish.
**Tasks**

* Main menu: New Game, Difficulty selector, Quit.
* In-game HUD: score, current turn, undo/redo, pass button.
* Settings: sound on/off, animation speed, board skins (themes).
* Add subtle animations and sounds for flips, invalid move attempt, game end.
* Localize strings (optional).
  **Deliverable:** polished, modern UI around the canvas.

---

## Phase 6 — Integration, concurrency & UX robustness

**Goal:** merge logic, AI, and UI into a smooth user experience.
**Tasks**

* Architecture: separate Model (game logic), View (renderer), Controller (input & UI). Keep coupling low.
* Run AI in background threads so UI remains responsive. Handle thread safety (copy state for AI, or use mutexes carefully).
* Add an event/message queue between game model and UI.
* Implement save/load game and persistent settings.
  **Deliverable:** non-blocking gameplay, stable integration.

---

## Phase 7 — Testing, profiling & polish

**Goal:** find and fix logic, performance, and UX bugs.
**Tasks**

* Unit tests for model & AI; integration tests for end-to-end flows.
* Fuzz test move generation (random sequences).
* Profile AI to ensure hard difficulty is performant; add incremental improvements (move ordering, caching).
* Gather a short playtest checklist and address common issues (incorrect flipping, ties, passes).
  **Deliverable:** stable, tested product.

---

## Phase 8 — Packaging & distribution (macOS)

**Goal:** produce a macOS app bundle you can run/share.
**Tasks**

* Create a macOS app bundle (`.app`) using CMake/Xcode build settings or `cpack`.
* Prepare assets (icons, retina resources).
* (Optional later) codesign and notarize if you want to distribute widely.
  **Deliverable:** runnable `.app` for macOS.

---

## Phase 9 — Optional advanced features

**Ideas you can add later**

* Network multiplayer (peer-to-peer or server).
* Replayer: export/import game records, step through moves.
* Tournament mode and AI self-play logs.
* Adaptive AI that learns weights from play (research project).
* Accessibility: keyboard controls, colorblind-friendly palettes.

---

# Suggested milestones (release slices)

* **M0 (proof):** Phase 0 + Phase 1 — console engine that enforces rules.
* **M1 (AI):** Add Phase 3 — three AI difficulties, CLI play vs AI.
* **M2 (graphics):** Phase 4 — board rendered and interactive.
* **M3 (polish):** Phase 5 + 6 — full UI and smooth gameplay.
* **M4 (ship):** Phase 7 + 8 — tested app bundle.

---

# What you’ll learn at each phase

* Phase 1–2: game logic, testing, data structures, debugging.
* Phase 3: search algorithms, heuristics, performance tuning.
* Phase 4–5: rendering, event loops, UI/UX design for games.
* Phase 6–8: concurrency, architecture, packaging for macOS.

If that looks good, we’ll begin **Phase 1 (Core game model)** next. I’ll give you exactly the C++ classes, method names, method signatures, and small pseudocode snippets you need to implement (no full files). Say **“Start Phase 1”** when you’re ready and I’ll hand you the first concept to implement.
